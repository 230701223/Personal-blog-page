This project was conceptualized and developed as a personal initiative to showcase my web development skills and passion for modern UI/UX design. I utilized core front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully responsive and visually engaging personal blog. Each section—from the About to the Journey—was thoughtfully structured to reflect both my technical background and personal achievements. I also integrated animation effects using the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library to enhance user interaction and engagement. Throughout the development process, I focused on clean code practices, responsiveness, and intuitive navigation to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
